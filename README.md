# Bisection-method
The bisection method, also known as the binary search method, is a fundamental numerical technique employed in mathematics and computer science. This approach serves as a powerful tool for finding approximate solutions to mathematical equations, particularly when dealing with functions that are continuous and change sign over a specified interval.
